# Memory-block-game

A fun and interactive memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Flip blocks to reveal hidden images and match pairs to win the game!

A "Memory Block" game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is a classic matching game where players must flip over pairs of blocks to reveal hidden images, aiming to find matching pairs by memory alone. The game typically features a grid of blocks, each initially displaying a blank face, and the player clicks on blocks to flip them over, revealing an image underneath. If the two flipped blocks match, they stay revealed; if not, they flip back over, and the player continues clicking to find more pairs.
